# xG_model_python
This repository contains code to predict the Expected Goals (xG) from events data in football using machine learning models.
## What'is an xG model?
Expected Goals **xG** is a statistical metric in football (soccer) that estimates the likelihood of a scoring opportunity resulting in a goal. Machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks, are trained on historical shot data and various factors like shot location, angle, and type (header, free kick, etc.) to assign a probability value between 0 (almost no chance) and 1 (almost certain goal).  xG helps analyze the quality of scoring opportunities and assess team and player performance beyond simply goals scored.
# Machine Learning  and "xG"
A statistical metric in football (soccer) that estimates the likelihood of a scoring opportunity resulting in a goal. It's essentially a **classification** problem where machine learning models are trained on historical shot data and various factors like location, angle, and type (header, free kick, etc.). These models, such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Deep Neural Networks**,  predict the probability of a shot resulting in a goal (between 0 and 1).  xG goes beyond goals scored to analyze the quality of chances and assess team/player performance.
Note that a significant portion of this code was inspired by the Kaggle page: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/usamawaheed/expected-goals-xg-model]
